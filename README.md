# Aurora Stock (JS + Vite)

This is a **JavaScript** version of the Aurora Stock Control UI.

It is a complete Vite + React + Tailwind project with three demo pages:

- Dashboard
- Inventory
- Alerts

The data on these pages is currently **mocked** (hard-coded) so that the UI
works without any backend. Later, you can wire it to a real API.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Where to put this

- Extract this folder into your GitHub Desktop repo folder for `aurora-stock`.
- GitHub Desktop will show all files as new.
- Commit & push to put the full project into GitHub.
